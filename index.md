### About the Team

I am a senior double majoring in computer science and data science with a domain emphasis in robotics. My interest in robotics spans a wide range of areas within the field, including the area of robotic swarms. My experience lies primarily in engineering rather than research, and as such, my intrigue in swarms is tied to their many potential applications.


## Our Project

We set out to gain a comprehensive understanding of robotic swarms in several contexts. Our approach was to survey a range of research papers focusing on topics such as decentralized motion planning, obstacle avoidance, shape formation, and the hardware needed to accomplish the aforementioned. Through the knowledge gained from these literature reviews, we implemented our own robotic swarm decentralized motion planner for shape formation with the intent of acquiring a more nuanced, hands-on intuition for the subject. 

The project is of interest because there are a myriad of useful applications that could follow from a successful implementation. In most realistic settings, obstacles are inevitably part of the workspace â€“ whether it be debris, furniture, or features specific to the environment. Shape formation is also an essential to performing divvied up tasks in dynamic circumstances. For instance, in the context of a warehouse setting,
a swarm of robots dispersed across the floor would only be useful if it could navigate through the obstacles one may encounter in such an environment like package racks and lifts. Each robot in the swarm would also have to reach a target position in a formation defined by the locations where tasks are to be completed. While this is occurring, for the purpose of convenience and efficiency, the productivity of the entire swarm should not be compromised by a subgroup malfunctioning agents. This is realized through decentralization. 

In the following sections, the research papers and our implementation are described in more detail.

### Literature Reviews

We reviewed a total of 8 papers. As mentioned above, each of them involve one or more of the following categories: decentralized motion planning, shape formation, obstacle avoidance, and hardware. The papers are listed and ordered below accordingly. 

#_Shape Formation in Homogenous Swarms Using Local Task Swapping_

_Programmable Self-Disassembly for Shape Formation in Large-Scale Robot Collectives_

_A Fast, Accurate, and Scalable Probabilistic Sample-Based Approach for Counting Swarm Size_

_Interplay of Two Bat Algorithm Robotic Swarms in Non-Cooperative Target Point Search_

_A Swarm Robotic Exploration Strategy Based on an Improved Random Walk Method_

_A Decentralized Control Algorithm for Swarm Behavior and Obstacle Avoidance in Unknown Environments_
